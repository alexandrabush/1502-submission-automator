# 1502-submission-automator
Tired of typing in your registration code every time you submit homework? Of course you are, you lazy bum you!
This simple script will launch the Submit program and then copy your registration code to your clipboard.
Then all you have to do is paste you registration code into the proper box. Easy as pie!

To get it working, download as a zip and install as a service. You can then open it in Automator and insert your registration code where it says "YOUR REGISTRATION CODE HERE"
I then recommend that you create a custom shortcut to launch the service. I used CONTROL-OPTION-CMD-C.
By setting up a custom shortcut, you can invoke the service easily, which will launch the Submit program automatically and copy your reg code to the clipboard. 
Enjoy!
